              Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for Ruby
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a SOAP library that uses the functionality in Windows Remote
Management(WinRM) to call native object in Windows.  This includes, but is
not limitted to, running batch scripts, powershell scripts and fetching WMI
variables.  For more information on WinRM, please visit Microsoft's WinRM
site: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426(v=VS.85).aspx

Version 1.0.0rc1

This is a release candidate of the new version 1 code for Ruby WinRM. It
is almost a complete re-write from the previous version to support some
of the following major feature additions:

1. GSSAPI support:  This is the default way that Windows authenticates and
   secures WinRM messages. In order for this to work the computer you are
   connecting to must be a part of an Active Directory domain and you must
   have local credentials via kinit. GSSAPI support is dependent on the
   gssapi gem which only supports the MIT Kerberos libraries at this time.

   If you are using this method there is no longer a need to change the
   WinRM service authentication settings. You can simply do a
   'winrm quickconfig' on your server or enable WinRM via group policy and
   everything should be working.

2. Multi-Instance support:  The SOAP back-end has been completely gutted
   and is now using some of the Savon core libraries for parsing and
   building packets. Moving away from Handsoap allows multiple instances
   to be created because the SOAP backend is no longer a Singleton type
   class.

INSTALL:
gem install -r winrm
.. on the server 'winrm quickconfig' as admin

USE:
require 'winrm'

EXAMPLE:
require 'winrm'
endpoint = http://mywinrmhost:5985/wsman
krb5_realm = 'EXAMPLE.COM'
winrm = WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :kerberos, :realm => krb5_realm)
winrm.cmd('ipconfig /all') do |stdout, stderr|
  STDOUT.print stdout
  STDERR.print stderr
end


CONNECTION TYPES:

PLAINTEXT:
  WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :plaintext, :user => myuser, :pass => mypass)
  # Same but force basic authentication
  WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :plaintext, :user => myuser, :pass => mypass, :basic_auth_only => true)
SSL:
  WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :ssl, :user => myuser, :pass => mypass)
  # Same but force basic authentication
  WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :ssl, :user => myuser, :pass => mypass, :basic_auth_only => true)
KERBEROS:
  WinRM::WinRMWebService.new(endpoint, :kerberos, :realm => 'MYREALM.COM')
